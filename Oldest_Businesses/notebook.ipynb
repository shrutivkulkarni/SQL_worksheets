It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe, such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?\n\nTo help answer this question, BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company still in business in **almost** every country and compiled the results into several CSV files. This dataset has been cleaned.\n\nHaving useful information in different files is a common problem. While it's better to keep different types of data separate for data storage, you'll want all the data in one place for analysis. You'll use joining and data manipulation to work with this data and better understand the world's oldest businesses.\n\n## The Data\n`businesses` and
